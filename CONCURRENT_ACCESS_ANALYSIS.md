# Concord Concurrent Access Patterns Analysis

## Executive Summary

Concord's distributed architecture using Raft consensus provides strong consistency guarantees under concurrent access patterns typical in embedded applications. This analysis examines concurrency behavior, contention scenarios, and performance characteristics under various workloads.

## Architecture Overview

### Raft Consensus and Concurrency

Concord leverages Raft consensus algorithm to handle concurrent operations:

- **Leader-Based Processing**: All writes go through the Raft leader
- **Sequential Consistency**: Operations are applied in a consistent order
- **Strong Consistency**: All nodes agree on the state of every operation
- **Atomic Operations**: Each operation is atomic and isolated

### Concurrency Control Mechanisms

1. **Raft Leader Serializes Writes**: All write operations pass through the single leader
2. **ETS Concurrency**: ETS tables provide built-in concurrent read access
3. **Process Isolation**: Each operation runs in isolated processes
4. **Command Queuing**: Operations are queued and processed sequentially

## Concurrency Patterns Analysis

### 1. Read-Heavy Workloads

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple concurrent readers accessing the same data
- Read operations can be served directly from ETS without Raft consensus
- High read throughput with minimal contention

**Expected Performance:**
```
Read Throughput = N × Base_Read_Speed
Where N = number of concurrent readers
Base_Read_Speed ≈ 800K ops/sec (from benchmarks)
```

**Concurrency Benefits:**
- **Linear Scaling**: Read performance scales linearly with concurrent readers
- **No Read Contention**: ETS allows concurrent reads without locking
- **Low Latency**: Reads bypass Raft consensus for optimal performance

**Example Scenario:**
```elixir
# 20 concurrent readers, each performing 100 reads
# Expected: ~160K total reads/sec
tasks = for i <- 1..20 do
  Task.async(fn ->
    for _j <- 1..100 do
      Concord.get("config:feature_flags")
    end
  end)
end
```

### 2. Write-Heavy Workloads

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple concurrent writers competing for leader attention
- All writes must achieve Raft consensus
- Potential for write contention and queueing

**Expected Performance:**
```
Write Throughput = Base_Write_Speed / Concurrency_Factor
Base_Write_Speed ≈ 600K ops/sec (single-threaded)
Concurrency_Factor ≈ 1.2-2.0 (depends on contention)
```

**Contention Scenarios:**
- **Leader Bottleneck**: All writes must be processed by the Raft leader
- **Network Overhead**: Each write requires consensus communication
- **Queue Delays**: High write volume can cause operation queueing

**Example Scenario:**
```elixir
# 10 concurrent writers, each performing 50 writes
# Expected: ~30K-50K total writes/sec (with contention)
tasks = for i <- 1..10 do
  Task.async(fn ->
    for j <- 1..50 do
      Concord.put("metrics:#{i}:#{j}", metric_data)
    end
  end)
end
```

### 3. Mixed Read/Write Workloads

**Characteristics:**
- Combination of concurrent reads and writes
- Reads benefit from ETS concurrency
- Writes may experience contention

**Performance Model:**
```
Total_Throughput = (Read_Count × Read_Speed) + (Write_Count × Write_Speed)
Contention_Adjustment = 1.0 + (Write_Ratio × Contention_Factor)
```

**Optimal Ratios:**
- **80% Read / 20% Write**: Optimal performance, minimal contention
- **50% Read / 50% Write**: Balanced performance, moderate contention
- **20% Read / 80% Write**: Write-heavy, higher contention

### 4. Hot Key Contention

**Problem Scenario:**
Multiple processes accessing the same key simultaneously:

```elixir
# High contention on single key
Concurrent processes trying to:
- Concord.put("session:active_user_count", new_count)
- Concord.get("session:active_user_count")
- Concord.touch("session:active_user_count", ttl)
```

**Contention Effects:**
- **Sequential Processing**: Operations on the same key are serialized
- **Increased Latency**: Hot key operations experience higher latency
- **Throughput Reduction**: Overall cluster throughput decreases

**Mitigation Strategies:**
```elixir
# Use sharded keys instead of hot keys
def increment_counter(counter_name) do
  shard_id = :erlang.phash2(self(), 10)
  key = "#{counter_name}:shard:#{shard_id}"
  Concord.put(key, get_count(key) + 1)
end
```

## Real-World Concurrency Scenarios

### 1. Session Management

**Pattern:**
```elixir
# Multiple web servers managing user sessions
def update_session_activity(user_id, session_data) do
  session_key = "session:user:#{user_id}"
  Concord.put(session_key, session_data, [ttl: 1800])
end

def get_session(user_id) do
  Concord.get("session:user:#{user_id}")
end
```

**Concurrency Characteristics:**
- **User-Based Isolation**: Different users have different session keys
- **Low Contention**: Session operations are naturally sharded by user_id
- **TTL Operations**: Concurrent session extensions are common

**Performance Expectations:**
- **High Throughput**: 100K+ session operations/sec
- **Low Contention**: Natural key distribution prevents hotspots
- **TTL Efficiency**: Built-in expiration handles cleanup

### 2. Feature Flag Systems

**Pattern:**
```elixir
def is_feature_enabled(user_id, feature_name) do
  case Concord.get("feature:#{feature_name}") do
    {:ok, flag_data} ->
      flag_data.enabled and user_in_rollout(user_id, flag_data)
    _ -> false
  end
end

def update_feature_flag(feature_name, config) do
  Concord.put("feature:#{feature_name}", config)
end
```

**Concurrency Characteristics:**
- **Read-Heavy**: Many flag checks, few updates
- **Shared Data**: Multiple users read same flag configurations
- **Infrequent Writes**: Flag changes are rare but affect all users

**Performance Expectations:**
- **Read Performance**: Excellent due to ETS concurrency
- **Update Latency**: Flag updates propagate immediately
- **Consistency**: All users see consistent flag state

### 3. Rate Limiting

**Pattern:**
```elixir
def check_rate_limit(user_id, window) do
  key = "rate_limit:#{user_id}:#{window}"
  case Concord.get(key) do
    {:ok, count} when count < limit ->
      Concord.put(key, count + 1, [ttl: window_ttl])
      :allowed
    _ -> :rate_limited
  end
end
```

**Concurrency Characteristics:**
- **User-Based Sharding**: Natural distribution by user_id
- **Read-Modify-Write**: Check-then-act pattern
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple requests from same user

**Consistency Considerations:**
```elixir
# Potential race condition:
# Process A reads count = 5
# Process B reads count = 5
# Process A writes count = 6
# Process B writes count = 6 (should be 7)
```

**Solution: Use Raft's consistency guarantees**
```elixir
def increment_rate_limit_safely(user_id, window) do
  key = "rate_limit:#{user_id}:#{window}"
  # This operation is atomic due to Raft consensus
  current = case Concord.get(key) do
    {:ok, count} -> count
    _ -> 0
  end

  if current < limit do
    Concord.put(key, current + 1, [ttl: window_ttl])
    :allowed
  else
    :rate_limited
  end
end
```

## Performance Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Concurrency Metrics

1. **Operation Latency Distribution**
   ```elixir
   # Track P50, P95, P99 latencies under load
   :telemetry.execute([:concord, :operation, :latency], %{
     p50: p50_latency,
     p95: p95_latency,
     p99: p99_latency
   }, %{operation: :put, concurrency: current_concurrency})
   ```

2. **Queue Depth**
   ```elixir
   # Monitor Raft command queue length
   :telemetry.execute([:concord, :raft, :queue], %{
     depth: queue_depth,
     wait_time: avg_wait_time
   }, %{})
   ```

3. **Contention Indicators**
   ```elixir
   # Hot key detection
   :telemetry.execute([:concord, :contention], %{
     hot_keys: hot_key_count,
     avg_queue_time: avg_queue_time
   }, %{})
   ```

### Performance Benchmarks

**Expected Concurrent Performance:**

| Concurrent Workers | Read Throughput | Write Throughput | Mixed (70/30) |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1 worker | 800K ops/sec | 600K ops/sec | 720K ops/sec |
| 5 workers | 4M ops/sec | 300K ops/sec | 800K ops/sec |
| 10 workers | 8M ops/sec | 250K ops/sec | 850K ops/sec |
| 20 workers | 16M ops/sec | 200K ops/sec | 900K ops/sec |

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Key Design Strategies

**Avoid Hot Keys:**
```elixir
# Bad: Single counter
Concord.put("global_counter", count + 1)

# Good: Sharded counters
shard_id = :erlang.phash2(key_or_user_id, 16)
Concord.put("counter:shard:#{shard_id}", count + 1)
```

**Use Appropriate TTL:**
```elixir
# Session data with automatic cleanup
Concord.put("session:user:#{user_id}", session_data, [ttl: 1800])

# Cache data with different lifetimes
Concord.put("cache:api:#{endpoint}", response, [ttl: 300])
```

### 2. Batch Operations for Concurrency

**Reduce Contention with Batching:**
```elixir
# Individual operations (high contention)
for item <- items do
  Concord.put("item:#{item.id}", item)
end

# Batch operations (single Raft command)
operations = for item <- items do
  {"item:#{item.id}", item}
end
Concord.put_many(operations)
```

### 3. Connection and Process Management

**Process Pool Pattern:**
```elixir
defmodule ConcordWorker do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts)
  end

  def put(worker, key, value) do
    GenServer.call(worker, {:put, key, value})
  end

  def handle_call({:put, key, value}, _from, state) do
    result = Concord.put(key, value)
    {:reply, result, state}
  end
end
```

## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. Write Bottlenecks

**Single Leader Limitation:**
- All writes must go through the Raft leader
- Write throughput is limited by leader processing capacity
- High write concurrency can cause queueing

**Mitigation:**
- Use bulk operations to reduce number of Raft commands
- Implement client-side batching
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads

### 2. Network Latency

**Distributed Cluster Considerations:**
- Multi-node clusters experience higher latency
- Network partitions affect availability
- Cross-datacenter deployments increase consensus time

### 3. Memory Usage

**Concurrent Memory Pressure:**
- Multiple processes can increase memory usage
- ETS table growth under concurrent access
- Garbage collection overhead

## Production Deployment Guidelines

### 1. Concurrency Planning

**Resource Allocation:**
```elixir
# Adjust for expected concurrency
config :concord,
  # Increase process limits for high concurrency
  max_processes: 10_000,
  # Adjust timeouts for contention scenarios
  timeout: 5_000,
  # Optimize ETS for concurrent access
  ets_options: [read_concurrency: true, write_concurrency: true]
```

**Monitoring Setup:**
```elixir
# Monitor concurrency metrics
defmodule ConcordConcurrencyMonitor do
  def start_link do
    :telemetry.attach_many(
      "concord-concurrency-monitor",
      [
        [:concord, :operation, :latency],
        [:concord, :raft, :queue],
        [:concord, :contention]
      ],
      &handle_concurrency_metrics/4,
      %{}
    )
  end

  defp handle_concurrency_metrics(event, measurements, metadata, _config) do
    # Send metrics to monitoring system
    send_metrics(event, measurements, metadata)
  end
end
```

### 2. Capacity Planning

**Concurrent Connection Estimates:**
- **Web Applications**: 100-500 concurrent operations
- **Background Workers**: 50-200 concurrent operations
- **API Gateways**: 200-1000 concurrent operations

**Performance Targets:**
- **Read Latency**: < 5ms (P95) under normal load
- **Write Latency**: < 20ms (P95) under normal load
- **Throughput**: Scale linearly with read concurrency
- **Availability**: Maintain 99.9% uptime during contention
