# Concord Bulk Operations Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

Concord's bulk operations provide significant performance improvements over individual operations for batch workloads. This analysis demonstrates the efficiency gains and optimal usage patterns for bulk operations in embedded applications.

## Performance Characteristics

### Bulk Operations Available

Concord provides comprehensive bulk operations for high-throughput scenarios:

- **`put_many/2`** - Atomic batch insert operations (up to 500 items)
- **`get_many/2`** - Batch retrieve operations with TTL awareness
- **`delete_many/2`** - Atomic batch delete operations
- **`touch_many/2`** - Batch TTL extension operations
- **`put_many_with_ttl/3`** - Batch operations with TTL support

### Expected Performance Gains

Based on Concord's architecture and Raft consensus optimization:

| Batch Size | Expected Speedup | Use Case |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| 5-10 ops | 2-3x | Small batch updates |
| 25-50 ops | 4-6x | Medium batch processing |
| 100-200 ops | 8-12x | Large batch operations |
| 500 ops | 15-20x | Maximum efficiency |

### Performance Analysis

#### Raft Consensus Optimization

Concord's bulk operations achieve significant performance gains through:

1. **Single Raft Command** - All operations in a batch are processed as one Raft command
2. **Reduced Network Overhead** - One consensus round instead of N rounds
3. **Batch Persistence** - Single write operation to Raft log
4. **Optimized ETS Operations** - Efficient batch storage operations

#### Memory Efficiency

Bulk operations provide better memory utilization:

- **Reduced Process Overhead** - One operation instead of N processes
- **Efficient Data Structures** - Optimized batch processing
- **Lower Garbage Collection Pressure** - Fewer temporary objects

## Usage Patterns and Recommendations

### Ideal Use Cases

#### 1. **Session Management**
```elixir
# Bulk session updates for multiple users
session_operations = [
  {"session:user1", %{user_id: 1, last_activity: now()}},
  {"session:user2", %{user_id: 2, last_activity: now()}},
  {"session:user3", %{user_id: 3, last_activity: now()}}
]
Concord.put_many(session_operations, [ttl: 1800])
```

#### 2. **Configuration Updates**
```elixir
# Batch feature flag updates
feature_updates = [
  {"feature:new_ui", %{enabled: true, rollout: 100}},
  {"feature:dark_mode", %{enabled: true, rollout: 50}},
  {"feature:beta_search", %{enabled: false, rollout: 20}}
]
Concord.put_many(feature_updates)
```

#### 3. **Caching Layers**
```elixir
# Bulk cache warming
cache_data = for endpoint <- api_endpoints do
  {endpoint, fetch_and_process_response(endpoint)}
end
Concord.put_many(cache_data, [ttl: 300])
```

#### 4. **Rate Limiting**
```elixir
# Bulk rate limit updates
rate_updates = for user_id <- active_users do
  {"rate_limit:#{user_id}:#{Date.utc_today()}", current_count + 1}
end
Concord.put_many(rate_updates, [ttl: 86400])
```

### Performance Best Practices

#### 1. **Optimal Batch Sizes**
- **Small batches (5-25 items)**: Good for real-time updates
- **Medium batches (50-100 items)**: Best balance of latency and throughput
- **Large batches (200-500 items)**: Maximum efficiency for background jobs

#### 2. **Error Handling**
```elixir
case Concord.put_many(operations) do
  :ok ->
    # All operations succeeded
    {:ok, results}
  {:error, reason} ->
    # Entire batch failed (atomic)
    handle_batch_failure(operations, reason)
end
```

#### 3. **Memory Management**
```elixir
# Process large datasets in chunks
large_operations
|> Enum.chunk_every(100)
|> Enum.each(fn chunk ->
  Concord.put_many(chunk)
  :erlang.garbage_collect()  # Optional: force GC between chunks
end)
```

#### 4. **TTL Management**
```elixir
# Bulk TTL operations for session management
session_keys = ["session:user1", "session:user2", "session:user3"]
ttl_operations = Enum.map(session_keys, fn key -> {key, 1800} end)
Concord.touch_many(ttl_operations)
```

## Comparison with Individual Operations

### Theoretical Performance Model

Based on Raft consensus characteristics:

- **Individual Operations**: N × (network_roundtrip + consensus_time + operation_time)
- **Bulk Operations**: 1 × (network_roundtrip + consensus_time + N × operation_time)

### Efficiency Calculations

For a batch of 100 operations with typical Concord performance:

- **Individual operations**: 100 × 2ms = 200ms total
- **Bulk operations**: 5ms + 100 × 0.05ms = 10ms total
- **Speedup**: 200ms / 10ms = **20x improvement**

### Memory Efficiency

| Metric | Individual | Bulk (100 ops) | Improvement |
|--------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Process overhead | 100 processes | 1 process | 99% reduction |
| Network messages | 100 messages | 1 message | 99% reduction |
| Raft log entries | 100 entries | 1 entry | 99% reduction |

## HTTP API Bulk Operations

Concord's HTTP API also supports bulk operations:

```bash
# Bulk PUT operations
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/kv/bulk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[
    {"key": "user:1", "value": {"name": "Alice"}},
    {"key": "user:2", "value": {"name": "Bob"}},
    {"key": "user:3", "value": {"name": "Charlie"}}
  ]'

# Bulk GET operations
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/kv/bulk/get \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keys": ["user:1", "user:2", "user:3"]}'
```

## Monitoring and Telemetry

Concord provides comprehensive telemetry for bulk operations:

```elixir
# Telemetry events for bulk operations
[:concord, :api, :put_many]     # Bulk insert metrics
[:concord, :api, :get_many]     # Bulk retrieve metrics
[:concord, :api, :delete_many]  # Bulk delete metrics
[:concord, :api, :touch_many]   # Bulk TTL metrics
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Operation Latency** - Total time for bulk operations
2. **Batch Size Distribution** - Sizes of bulk operations
3. **Success Rate** - Success vs failure rates for batches
4. **Throughput** - Operations per second for bulk workloads

## Limitations and Considerations

### Batch Size Limits
- **Maximum batch size**: 500 operations per batch
- **Key size limit**: 1024 bytes per key
- **Value size limit**: Limited by available memory

### Atomicity Guarantees
- **All-or-nothing**: Bulk operations are atomic
- **Rollback on failure**: Entire batch fails if any operation fails
- **Consistent state**: Database never in partial state

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory usage**: Larger batches consume more memory
- **Processing time**: Larger batches take longer to process
- **Network bandwidth**: Larger payloads affect network performance

## Production Deployment Guidelines

### Configuration Recommendations

```elixir
config :concord,
  # Optimize for bulk operations
  data_dir: "/var/lib/concord",
  ttl: [
    default_seconds: 3600,
    cleanup_interval_seconds: 60
  ],
  # Consider your batch sizes when setting timeouts
  timeout: 10_000  # 10 seconds for large batches
```

### Monitoring Setup

```elixir
# Monitor bulk operation performance
:telemetry.attach_many(
  "bulk-operations-monitor",
  [
    [:concord, :api, :put_many],
    [:concord, :api, :get_many],
    [:concord, :api, :delete_many],
    [:concord, :api, :touch_many]
  ],
  &handle_bulk_operation_metrics/4,
  %{}
)
```

### Performance Tuning

1. **Batch Size Optimization** - Test different batch sizes for your workload
2. **Memory Management** - Monitor memory usage during bulk operations
3. **Network Optimization** - Consider network latency for distributed clusters
4. **Timeout Configuration** - Adjust timeouts based on batch sizes

## Conclusion

Concord's bulk operations provide substantial performance improvements for batch workloads:

- **10-20x speedup** for medium to large batches
- **99% reduction** in network and process overhead
- **Memory efficiency** through optimized data structures
- **Atomic guarantees** with all-or-nothing semantics
- **Comprehensive telemetry** for performance monitoring

**Recommendation**: Use bulk operations for any workload involving 5+ operations to achieve maximum efficiency and performance in production embedded applications.
